## What is Miget?

[Miget](https://miget.com) is the platform that created and maintains migetpacks. When you deploy on Miget, migetpacks is natively integrated. Your code is automatically detected, built, and deployed without any configuration.

Miget lets you run unlimited applications on a single compute resource with a fair scheduler that intelligently distributes CPU across your workloads. Each app runs in an isolated microVM with managed databases, custom domains, and unmetered bandwidth included.

## How it works

Push your code to Miget and the platform automatically uses migetpacks to:

- Detect your language and version from source
- Generate an optimized multi-stage Dockerfile
- Build a secure, non-root container image
- Deploy it across Miget's infrastructure

No Dockerfile, no build configuration, and no CI pipeline to maintain.
